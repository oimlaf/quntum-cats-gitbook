# üê± OP\_CAT Solution

The solution to the problem associated with the use of OP\_CAT in TapScript includes improvements aimed at ensuring safety and predictability in the context of scripting operations. The introduction of TapScript has provided effective measures to overcome the limitations associated with the use of OP\_CAT and has created more robust processing mechanisms.

### Maximum stack element size

**Problem:** the main problem for OP\_CAT implementation was the maximum stack element size. The previous OP\_CAT-based mechanism could lead to an exponential increase in memory usage, creating potential security risks.

**Solution:** TapScript sets the maximum stack element size by limiting it to 520 bytes. This ensures that the stack size remains predictable and does not cause performance or security issues.

### Optimization for security

**Problem:** OP\_CAT could cause data management problems in scripts, especially with repetitive operations.

**Solution:** TapScript implements additional checks and constraints designed to prevent possible attacks and provide stable security.

### Ensuring compatibility

**Problem:** The change may have affected compatibility with previous versions of the scripts.

**Soution:** Enhancements to TapScript are made with compatibility with existing scripts in mind, ensuring a smooth transition to new data processing mechanisms.



All of TapRoot's innovations combined, provide a direct path for the return of the OP\_CAT opcode, which will expand the ability to write smart contracts, giving developers more tools.
