# üêà What is OP\_CAT?

As sad as it may sound, the acronym OP\_CAT has nothing to do with the kitties we all love so much. OP\_CAT stands for Operation Code Concatenate, and it is an opcode used for concatenation, i.e. concatenating (combining) data.

### OP\_CAT operating principe

The working principle of OP\_CAT can be described in just three basic steps:

1. **Data preparation.** Two elements representing the rows of data to be combined are placed on the stack;
2. **Performing the operation.** The concatenation of these strings is then performed with OP\_CAT, creating a new string that contains the combined data of both original strings;
3. **Result to stack.** The concatenation result is placed back on the stack, and the script continues execution based on this new stack state

An example of using OP\_CAT for beginners:

```
Input Data: "Hello, " "world!"

*/ OP_CAT CALL /*

Output Data: "Hello, world!"
```

### Possibilities of using OP\_CAT in Bitcoin scenarios.

The possibilities of using the OP\_CAT opcode in Bitcoin system scenarios are almost endless, but we can try to highlight the main ones:

* **Smart Contract Construction.** OP\_CAT could be used to create complex scenarios in smart contracts, where string concatenation could be one of the steps to define payment terms or other actions;
* **Integration with external data.** If the blockchain interacts with external data, OP\_CAT can be used to integrate that data with the transaction's internal data;
* **Creating unique transaction labels.** OP\_CAT can be used to create unique transaction labels or identifiers based on the concatenation of various transaction attributes;
* **Combining data for access control.** Within smart contracts, OP\_CAT can be used to create complex access control conditions that depend on a specific combination of data.
